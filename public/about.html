<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Divya—a web developer with a passion for creating intuitive and engaging digital experiences. 
I specialize in designing and developing websites that are not only visually appealing but also 
highly functional, user-friendly, and optimized for performance.</p>

<p>My journey into web development began with a curiosity for technology and a love for problem-solving. 
Over the years, I’ve honed my skills in front-end and back-end development, working with various frameworks, 
programming languages, and tools to build websites that make a difference.

Beyond coding, I’m an avid reader and a firm believer in sustainable living. That’s what led me to create 
Rebook Reread—a platform dedicated to promoting the joy of second-hand books. I wanted to bridge the gap between 
technology and sustainability by developing a space where book lovers can buy, sell, and share pre-loved books, 
reducing waste while fostering a strong reading community.</p>

<p>Through Rebook Reread, I’ve combined my technical expertise with my personal mission: to make books more accessible 
and contribute to a more eco-conscious world. Whether you’re here to explore second-hand books or you’re interested in 
web development, I’d love to connect and share ideas.

Let’s build, innovate, and keep the pages turning—both in books and in the digital world!</p>
